Utseende:
Rüben har en väldigt simpel men lite avikande utseende som gör han lite vanlig. Rüben har mörkt hår och bruna ögon
med ett lite magert ansikte. Rüben ser väldigt bestämd ut och hans rustning gör denna profil mycket starkare.
Rustningen ser väldigt mycket ut som de vanliga soldaterna i landet. Rustningen har en stål glans med, väldigt breda axlar.
Rustning har spetsig fot, spetsiga knä och spetsiga armbågar som ska göra det lättare för soldaterna att döda sin motståndare.
Rüben har dock ingen hjälm och hans högra arm är helt oskyddad. Resten av skyddet är dock intakt och hans lands symbol bortskrapad.
För att kompensera höger armen har han lindat den i läder enda ifrån axeln till handen. Lädret är till för att skydda lite bättre än skin och
för att få bättre grep om vapen. Rustningen på höger armen gör det lättare för Rüben att svinga sitt vapen.

Rüben
Defender

Joining the royal army was good they all said. After years of battle training all you really do is standing next to a door.
Rüben however was not that kind of man. He was the best in training. Could take the strongest blows and still stand, use
magic like no other to boost his fellow spirits. However strength is never foolproof and Rüben was caught in the same trap as
everyone else. After serving 3 years as a door guard he had enough. He took up his sword and shield, looked for the 
most sought after villian and took off. To prove that once and for all, that not all men were meant for guard duty.
