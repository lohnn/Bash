Utseende:
Jonas ser lite gammal ut men ändå väldigt fräsch för sin ålder. Han rör sig på ett väldigt ståtligt sätt
och det märks att han är en adelsman. Jonas har blont-grått hår med ett väldigt avslappnat utseende.
Hans utstyrsel är en blandning mellan jakt och adels kläder. Han har en vit skjorta
med en jakt inspirerad frak på sig. På ryggen har han en mantel med axel skydd. Skydden är väldigt jakt inspirerade med brunn läder
och gröna fransar. Manteln i sig är svart med ull tyg. Hans vapen är ett luft gevär som har ett väldigt steampunk aktigt tema över sig. 
Hans gevär är väldigt inspirerat av 1800-talets vapen blandat med avancerat kol maskineri. 
Hans byxor är väldigt fina bomulls byxor som har fått lera nere vid vristerna. Hans skor är cowboy inspirerade boots med en finare 
klack på skon som ska avbilda hans adelsman roll. 

Count Jonas
The Shooter:

Having a career as a shooter with the eye of an eagle and wealth of a king, Count Jonas never had
any problems that he couldn't take care of. He managed to get married with the most beautiful
princess, get the strongest kids and not even have to work for it. At the peak of his fame he was starting
to get old. After his wife died he started to feel his energy flow ones again. No more need
to stay home, no one to look after. He set on the final adventure of his life, with hopes
that he could accomplish something that he haven't done before and that he would be remembered as a
hero and not a count.
