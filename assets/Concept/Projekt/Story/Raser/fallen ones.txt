When the brothers created the world Vitor made a race called chosen, they had no real powers and was not stronger than the other races.
After his brothers left, Vitor gave the fallen ones a great deal of his power to the fallen ones.
But what Vitor didn't know was that such a large power can not be contained by mere mortals.
The magic was very unstable weakening the fallen ones, generations after generations.
The chosen had no idea how they could stop it and a lot of chosens dedicated their life to stop the race from falling but what happend was beyond their control.
From being very pompous and proud people they fell and became mere shells of what they was when Vitor created them.
At this point Vitor considered them a failed project and renamed them the fallen ones.
Their magic altho powerful, is very unstable and if the fallen cast to strong spells or using to much magic power it can backfire on themself.
Many promising fallen ones dies in training because of this and talents are very rare in their ranks.
They are physically weak and their body is very weird looking, showing bones through their body.
The other races in the world doesn't know much about the fallen ones, they like to keep away from others.
They're mystic creatures craving for their old glory, still channeling magic trying to go back as the chosen.
