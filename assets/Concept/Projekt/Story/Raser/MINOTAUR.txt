The Minotaur was a race with no honor, they fought bloody, they fought hard.
These beast like creatures was for a long time living on their own at their camp, slaying anyone who got to their land.
But one day there was a very wise and strong redskin called Gnarr who traveled the land to seek the leader of the Minotaurs
to challenge him in combat.
The Minotaur leader that was unchallenged for many years was barely slain by Gnarr and for many Minotaurs he was seen as the
"Narvan", the name that the elder shamans in the clan had given the person that would come and bring peace for the Minotaurs.
Gnarr took on the role as the leader of the Minotaurs, guiding them and teaching them about honor.
One day Gnarr passed away but before he had left the Minotaurs he had given them a new leader that he had been a mentor for,
his name was Palemane.
Today Minotaurs sees Gnarr as a prophet and they are often honoring him by having big bonfires and celebrations in his name.
Palemane have grown very old and will soon have to chose another leader for the Minotaurs, everyone expect him to chose his son
Bloodmane who are the mightiest Minotaur that the clan have ever seen.
But Palemane is afraid that his son is following the path of the old Minotaurs, showing no honor or humbleness and have
decided that his son can not rule over the Minotaurs at any cost.
