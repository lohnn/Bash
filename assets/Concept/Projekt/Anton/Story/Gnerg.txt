Gnerg:

The Gnerg is very strange and mysterious creature. Usual traits is that they have high intelligence,
high creativity, they're very talk active and tricky little bastards.
Vitor created the race as his triumph card, only 20% of the race is very smart while the rest have
a very low intellect.
The smart Gnergs are often very cold and can't be bargained with, they're tricking people to
fund their experiments to make the race more powerfull.
The other Gnergs care about the other races and wants to share the technology to make
a bound of trust in the world. 
The dumb Gnergs are often slaves to the high Gnergs, while many of the smart Gnergs are selfish
and only work for themself, there is a few that have seen the ways and want to make a change.
