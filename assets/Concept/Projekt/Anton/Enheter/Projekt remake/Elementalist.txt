Elementalist:

There existed once a captain of a ship that was named Johnas. Having powerful mage blood in his veins he could navigate the frozen sea with almost inhuman powers. However one day the ice was tricky, as they passed
an ice mountain it suddenly started to collapse. He told all his men to stand at the middle of the boat and as they executed his order they saw in horror as their captain got crushed by the mountain.
As they row away on the lifeboat they knew that thier captain had all saved their lifes, and that they was honored. 
But something happened that day. Something woke Johnas up from his terrible fate. The blood in his
veins called and he was reborn. His name was no longer Johnas, because he had no name. He was from now know as the Elementalist.
