Surgoth
Poison maniac:

Once a herbalist, Surgoth was a rising star and his natural talent for herbs
was sought after over the whole country. Not liking the idea to only stay at one place,
he became a freelance herbalist. After 2 years of freelancing he met upon a strange witch.
She told him the story of a forbidden herb that can only be found in a cursed forest, that if
he give her the herb she will create a powerful potion that will make him strong.
Surgoth went to the forest and found the herb but it was a dangerous one. He was poisoned by the herb
and was only minutes away from passing when the witch got the herb. She mixed the potion as fast as she
could and gave it to him. He woke up but his body was deformed. Instead of blood, poison flowed through his veins.
Instead of saliva, acid. He was a monster but a powerful such, even though he is the strongest most toxic
being alive, he still wish that he can find an antidote someday. So he can become normal once again.
