Huvud karaktär: Yougach

Man får veta Yougach bakgrunds historia:

"I was not just a typical student at the magic university of Sirath. Even though I was teased for being different 
it didn't stop me from gaining more knowledge, and deeper understanding for the magic fusion with herbs.
 
After several years of study I became the best doctor that have ever existed, I was praised by everyone
and my family was proud. It felt like I had reached the apex in life.

But I can't stop this feeling... this feeling that I am still missing something...
Even though I reached my goal and made everyone I cared about happy there was something missing...

I set on a journey, to find the missing piece. To be fulfilled."

Yougach sets on a journey to find out what he was missing and to see if he really was the best herbalist in the world.

Yougach går till en bar vid ett berg och träffar på Gerch.

Gerch slåss mot ett fyllo, första fighten inleds och man får lära sig spel-grunderna.

Konversation:
Gerch:
"I will tear apart, stupid piece of shit"

Drunk:
"No, you!"

Gerch:
"Is that all? You shit"

Drunk:
"No, *hick* you are a ballerina not me"

Gerch:
"Hehe its time for me to invite to friend. His name is mister axe"

Gerch vinner slagsmålet oavsett.

Gerch:
"YEAH HAHA im the strongest... oh... he died"

Bar owner:
"Thats it get out! I don't want any more customers killed!"

Gerch blir utslängd.

Yougach går ut och har en konversation med Gerch.

Yougach:
"You seem wounded let me patch you up"

Gerch:
"NO! Wounds are strength, blood is the path of life"

Yougach:
"I know you are violent by nature but you need to patch up"
*Insert syringe*

Gerch:
"WHAT YOU DOING? IM GONN... oh wait that feels good"
"My name is Gerch, name?"

Yougach:
"Master degree Herbalist Youg..."

Gerch:
"I ask for name not history dumbass"

Yougach:
"Yougach... just Yougach"

Gerch:
"No last name?"

Yougach:
"I guess this game don't have any last names for us yet"

Gerch:
"What game? You play dice?"

Yougach:
"Nevermind"

Gerch:
"Whats your goal in life?"

Yougach:
"To find a missing piece in my life... you?"

Gerch:
"I am going to become the strongest warrior the land have ever seen, you can come with me"

Yougach:
"I would gladly, I think you will need me"

Gerch:
"I dont need anyone! ...but I need company"
"This Axe cannot talk you know"

Yougach:
"I guess, but its always good to have a herbalist Gerch"

Gerch:
"I dont believe in tales of fairys. In fight herbalist can only throw bag on enemies. Not effective"

Yougach:
"I guess you have a point"

Gerch:
"Enough talking! Lets kill monsters!"
