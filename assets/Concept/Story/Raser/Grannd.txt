Human:

As the three brothers came to earth the brother Grannd. Wanted to create a race that was aggresive and powerful but weak minded, easily corrupted.
And so the humans was born. First the humans acted as he thought, turning on eachother in a primitive way. However later on to his surprise the chaos
turned into a kingdom. The weak minded human managed to overcome his original purpose which showed Grannd that humans are able to adapt to almost any kind
of situation to survive. The humans continued to rise to power and was soon a dangerous foe to all the other races. 

The other brothers warned Grannd about
his creation that it have to much lust for power. Grannd then created a new kingdom in the desert, to create tension and war. As Grannd expected, the 
two kingdoms waged war on eachother fighting for several years to come reducing the growth of the humans. After a decade of war the kingdoms laid in ruins 
and an unwilling peace was created. Being happy with this sight and the struggle to survive Grannd left the humans to survive on thier own. A decade 
later the humans have grown in power being on thier way to the become the same kingdom that was defeated. Just like before the tension between the two 
kingdoms is growing, the war is on the way.

Magicae Human:

The Magicae Human is a not really a human at all. They are infact being created by pure magic. 
These "creatures" are consisting of magic causing them to be able to form themselves to whatever they like. The origin of these Magic humans is very
vauge. They are usually created from already existing human beings and some humans can transform into this form whenever they like. However to do so they 
need to destroy thier own body. Causing the effect to be irreversable. However these Magic humans are often seen as the guideline for magic out there.
Magic humans have always found new ways in magic some which have been almost impossible, they may not have as great impact on magic and history as 
Deathly Dwellers. But they are still a milestone in Magic and are always treated as such. The mysterious thing however is that they have a tendency to just
vanish. They just vanish from the earth and no one knows why. There have been theories but they have all but remain theories.
